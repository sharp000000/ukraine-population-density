# Visualization of population density in Ukraine using the folium library

[Nbviewer](https://nbviewer.org/) could be used for rendering [.ipynb](https://github.com/sharp000000/population-density/blob/master/Population%20Density.ipynb) notebooks. Interactive features of Jupyter notebooks like the folium maps couldn't be rendered due to the use of JavaScript.
